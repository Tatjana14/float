            <p class="text">Football is considered to be the most popular sport games in the world. It is my favourite game as well. Together with my dad we are fans of football. We always watch important football matches on TV. At weekends sometimes we go to our stadium to watch the games of local teams. The rules of football are quite simple. There are eleven players in each team. Every team tries to score as many goals as they can. No one is allowed to use hand while playing, only legs. The goalkeeper on the contrary uses hands to catch the ball. By its origin it’s an old game. They say that even in China at 400 BC games similar to football were played. Later, it was played in Ancient Egypt and Rome. Today this game is played in more than 140 countries. It is especially popular in some European and Latin American countries. Football is also played in the Olympics. Women’s football is a comparatively new game. Every year Europe houses FIFA Cup competitions and every four years – the World Cup.</p>
